ANALYSIS ON IPL DATA OF 13 YEARS

This project is part of Udacity Nano degree program for Data scientist. This project requires to write a Blog Post on a choosen topic and perform data analysis on a data set to answer 3-5 business/data questions. I have choosen IPL dataset to complete this project.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

In this we will understand what how we can find out certain aspects related to our IPL DATA like how to find the effects of toss in a match and many more.
I have chosen IPL dataset to complete this project.
This year IPL completed 13 years, in-spite of Covid-19 and unavailability of fans doesnt effected the popularity of IPL.In IPL 8 teams played matches against each other and at the end of the league stage 4 Teams qualify , for further matches and one of them emerges as winner.


BUSINESS QUESTIONS

1.We will see total matches played by each team and their winning percentage that will tell us which team have more winning percentage?
2.Which Stadium Hosted max number of matches?
3.How toss affects the outcome of the game?
4.In which IPL Season maximum no. of runs are scored?

DATA UNDERSTANDING

Files in this repository:
Readme file
IPL DATASET.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis and code
deliveries.csv : csv file containing ball by ball data for 13 years of IPL Games.
matches.csv : CSV file containing each match result, teams, winner, umpire, venue etc..

Details about the jupyter notebook: Analysis is performed using Libraries mentioned below:-

DATA PREPARATION

To prepare our data we need to carry some wrangling process to handle null and missing values , for this we use some libraries like:-
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib for visualization Notebook contains visuals to explain all the analysis done to answer the questions/objectives.
Seaborn also for Visualization to explain analysis



MODELING

In this analysis we didnâ€™t use any predictive model . We just used descriptive analysis

EVALUATION

1.WE can conclude that MUMBAI INDIANS have won maximum no. of matches and their winning percentage is also highest,so we can say that MUMBAI INDIANS is the most succesful team of IPL.
2.From our Analysis we found that Eden GArden Hosted maximum no. of IPL matches.
3.Clearly teams like Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians have better win percentage when they win toss.
4. we can say that in Season 2013 maximum no. of runs are scored with an average of 296.5 runs per match
